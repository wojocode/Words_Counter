# CountWords

## Overview

The `CountWords` class in Java is designed to count the frequency of each word in a text file. This utility reads through a specified file, counts how many times each word appears, and returns a list of words along with their respective counts.

## Features

- **File Input**: Takes the path of a text file as input.
- **Word Counting**: Efficiently counts the frequency of each word in the file.
- **Error Handling**: Checks if the file exists and throws `FileNotFoundException` if not.
- **Support for Punctuation**: Handles words adjacent to punctuation marks correctly.
